    <p1 id="hypothesis">The above data is taken from the USDA Economic Research Service. There are multiple ways to describe counties as urban, rural, metro, and nonmetro. The two tables provide a key to read the bar charts. The scatter plot on the far left shows percent unemployment since the turn of the century. Prior to the recession of 2008, unemployment was higher in nonmetro counties. However, since then, unemployment has been higher in metro counties until just last year. The middle chart shows median income for last year from the most urban to most rural counties. Clearly, income is highest in the most urban areas, with a general decreasing trend as the chart reaches the most rural areas. The bar chart on the right shows unemployment percentages for last year with a different scale for categorizing counties. Unemployment is the lowest in urban areas, with a rough increasing trend as the chart reaches more rural areas. <br><br>
    This data is intruiging, and there are clearly many possible explanations. The most likely is that, due to higher population density, there is more job availability in urban counties. In addition, living in a city is much more expensive, and in order for this to be sustainable, salaries need to be higher. In terms of recovery following the recession, it seems as though metro areas took longer to bounce back because cities are the economic powerhouses of this country and were hit the hardest. The trends consistently show that although rural counties face higher unemployment and lower salaries, they are more equipped to respond to economic harship.</p1>
